# SkillStack
🏗️ Project Name: SkillStack — Personal Growth Tracker
What it is:
A full-stack web app where users can log, manage, and track their learning, progress, and goals across different skills (like DSA, Cloud, System Design, etc.)

Why this is future-proof:

It's scalable (can expand to teams, AI suggestions, gamification, etc.)

It’s personal (every dev wants a tool to track growth)

Helps showcase multiple skills: CRUD, Auth, Roles, Analytics, Testing, Docs, and more
